    <p>Close to the Italian border lies the tiny city state of  Monaco, home to the rich and famous. Surrounded on three sides by France and by  the Mediterranean on the fourth, it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s second smallest country by  size. Monaco is a constitutional monarchy that has been ruled by the House of  Grimaldi with only brief interruptions since the thirteenth century.</p>
