		<h1>A Long Tale</h1>
			<p>&lsquo;Mine is a long and a sad tale!&rsquo; said the Mouse,  turning to Alice, and sighing.</p>
			<p>&lsquo;It IS a long tail, certainly,&rsquo; said Alice,  looking down with wonder at the Mouse&rsquo;s tail; &lsquo;but why do you call it sad?&rsquo; And  she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of  the tale was something like this:—</p>
			<div id="tail">
			              &#8216;Fury said to a
			             mouse, That he          
			            met in the
			           house,
			          &#8220;Let us        
			          both go to        
			           law: I will          
			            prosecute           
			             YOU.—Come,             
			              I&#8217;ll take no
			                denial; We
			               must have a          
			              trial: For        
			             really this       
			            morning I've
			           nothing     
			           to do.&#8221;      
			            Said the       
			             mouse to the         
			              cur, &#8220;Such         
			               a trial,           
			                dear Sir,
			                  With            
			                no jury          
			              or judge,         
			             would be       
			            wasting        
			            our        
			            breath.&#8221;         
			             &#8220;I&#8217;ll be          
			              judge, I&#8217;ll           
			               be jury,&#8221;
			                 Said           
			               cunning           
			                old Fury:            
			                &#8220;I&#8217;ll           
			                try the              
			                 whole              
			                 cause,
			                   and             
			                 condemn             
			                 you            
			                to             
			                 death.&#8221;&#8217;
			</div>
			<p>&lsquo;You are not attending!&rsquo;  said the Mouse to Alice severely. &lsquo;What are you thinking of?&rsquo; </p>
			<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo;  said Alice very humbly: &lsquo;you had got to the fifth bend, I think?&rsquo; </p>
			<p>&lsquo;I had NOT!&rsquo; cried the  Mouse, sharply and very angrily. </p>
			<p>&lsquo;A knot!&rsquo; said Alice,  always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. &lsquo;Oh, do  let me help to undo it!&rsquo; </p>
			<p>&lsquo;I shall do nothing of  the sort,&rsquo; said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. &lsquo;You insult me by  talking such nonsense!&rsquo; </p>
			<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it!&rsquo;  pleaded poor Alice. &lsquo;But you&rsquo;re so easily offended, you know!&rsquo; </p>
			<p>The Mouse only growled  in reply. </p>
			<p>&lsquo;Please come back and  finish your story!&rsquo; Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus,  &lsquo;Yes, please do!&rsquo; but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a  little quicker.</p>
